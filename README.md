This project focuses on analyzing retail sales data using Python and various data visualization techniques. It explores trends, patterns, and relationships between sales and other factors like temperature, fuel prices, and holidays.

# Objectives
Understand sales distribution across different stores.
Analyze the impact of holidays, fuel prices, and unemployment rates on sales.
Visualize monthly sales trends.
Identify correlations between numerical features and sales using scatter plots.

# Dataset
The dataset includes:
Store: Store number.
Date: Date of sales.
Weekly_Sales: Sales revenue for a given week.
Holiday_Flag: Whether the week includes a holiday (1: Yes, 0: No).
Temperature: Local temperature in Fahrenheit.
Fuel_Price: Cost of fuel in the area.
CPI (Consumer Price Index): A measure of inflation.
Unemployment: Unemployment rate in the region.

# Technologies Used
Python
Pandas for data manipulation
Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
Google Colab for execution
GitHub for version control

# Key Features & Analysis
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handle missing values.
Convert date column to a datetime format.
Convert categorical values for better analysis.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Sales Distribution: Histogram of sales values.
Sales by Category: Bar plots for categorical variables like Holiday_Flag.
Monthly Sales Trend: Line chart to show variations over time.
Scatter Plots: Relationship between Weekly_Sales and numerical features.
